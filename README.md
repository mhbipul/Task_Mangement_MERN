### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mhbipul/mern-task-manager.git
    cd mern-task-manager
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    Navigate to the `client` and `server` directories and install the required dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    cd ../server
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following variables:
    ```env
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
    ```

4. **Start the application**

    In the `server` directory, run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    In the `client` directory, run:
